# ZenAura â€” MERN Academic & Wellness Platform (Starter)

This repository contains a minimal starter scaffold for the ZenAura MERN application: a backend (Node/Express/MongoDB) and a frontend (React). This is a small, extendable base implementing authentication (JWT + bcrypt), role middleware and essential models.

See `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` for per-subproject instructions.

Next steps
- Edit `backend/.env.example` and create `.env` with your secrets (MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET).
- Run `npm install` in both `backend` and `frontend` and start servers following each README.
